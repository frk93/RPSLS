This is the First Project of Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python by Rice university ( Coursera ).
Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game that is played by two people. The players count to three in unison and simultaneously "throw” one of three hand signals that correspond to rock, paper or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:

1-> Rock smashes scissors
2-> Scissors cuts paper
3-> Paper covers rock

Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices and ties against itself. Much of RPSLS's popularity is that it has been featured in 3 episodes of the TV series "The Big Bang Theory" . 
In this expanded list, each choice wins against the preceding two choices and loses against the following two choices (if rock and scissors are thought of as being adjacent using modular arithmetic).
